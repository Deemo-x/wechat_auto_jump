## Adaptation

Current adaptation model:
<font color = grean>
Huawei P10, Huawei P10 plus, Xiaomi5, Xiaomi6, vivo x6s
</font>
<br>(If you don't find your model, please contact us or Refer to the mi6 template in the config folder and send us an email with your profile)</br>

### Self-adapting method (using Xiaomi6 as an example)

<font color = yellow>
    1. Create config/mi6.json
</font>

```python
    # config/mi6.json
    {
        "resolution": "1080p",
        # Replace '1080p' with your phone's screen resolution (currently supports 1080p and 2k)
        # If your resolution is not in it, follow the second step to create your own screen resolution file

        "coefficient": 1.37
        # '1.37' is the coefficient of the simulate click time, but we didn't find the law. Please try it yourself
    }
```

<font color = yellow>
    2. Create config/1080p.json
</font>

```python
    # config/mi6.json
    {
        "scale": 0.3
        # Piece identification coefficient, it has a positive correlation with screen resolution
    }

```
<font color = red>
&emsp;Do not add the prompt statement after <font color = yellowgreen>#</font> in the json file(refer to config/1080p.json and config/mi6.json)
</font>
